Unit tests for homework 3.

Put ListTests.java with the rest of your source files.
Put the tests/ directory in the root of you project (same directory as bin and src)

The provided tests are not extremely thorough, but hopefully they will help (in particular restock does not test every case).
Also note, I would not put all your trust in my tests for the print methods, they are based on the provided txt files, but
should be fairly leniant. I would test them more on your own until and compare to the provided text files under the
black board discussion, until you are satisfied with their performance.
